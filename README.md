## RNAseq

For submitting samples for RNAseq analysis make sure you will need to deposit your files in store-age.age.mpg.de/coworking/group_bit_all/automation. 

Make sure you create a folder eg. `John_Doe_sequencing_March2020` and that all your `fastq.gz` files are inside as well as your md5sums file (attention: only one md5sums file per project).

All files will have to be on your project folder (ie. `John_Doe_sequencing_March2020`) do create subfolders.

Once all the files have been copied download the submission template [here](https://datashare.mpcdf.mpg.de/s/exhJ4KWfkgGmJrH) and edit the "RNAseq" and "samples" sheets according to the "example" provided in the excel file.

If you have problems downloading your fastq.gz and md5sum files please contact the organization that sent you the files and ask them for support.

If you have problems accessing store-age.age.mpg.de/coworking/group_bit_all/submissions please contact it@age.mpg.de. 

If you have problems filling up the submission template please contact bioinformatics@age.mpg.de.

All files in store-age.age.mpg.de/coworking/group_bit_all/automation will be deleted after 30 days.
